Introduction
============

I always wanted to enter the NetFlix challenge, but I never got
serious about it, and now it's done.  Too bad.  But the Github Contest
is not done, and it has appealing open-source moral underpinnings::

========
Approach
========

I don't have too much time to devote to this, but I do have some, and
I already started a project that can quickly be repurposed, a
personalized pagerank (PPR) approach.  Originally, it was an attempt
to predict the cause-of-death from verbal autopsy data.  In that
setting, I found that PPR predictions did slightly worse than random
forests, but definitely better than they have any right to do.  In the
code repository recommendation setting, we shall see.


=======
Roadmap
=======

Since I don't have too much time to devote to this, I'm going to start
with a small experiment to see if the calculation is feasible with the
computer resources I have available right now.  If it's not, I can
give up.

* Step 1:  Can I calculate PPR on this .5M edge graph?

The Github Contest requires the sourcecode for all entries to be
released under an OSI compliant license.  I think that Affero GPL fits
best with the stated goals of the contest, it is what I plan to use:
